Thank you for your consideration! This is an application built with django + bootstrap. None of the database integrations work, though the migration file has been created. 

The front-end has been implemented, with pages in the django project, that have bootstrap css on them, and the django models, forms, URLs and view routing has been set up. However, most front-end pages are almost empty as their elements etc. are populated using the database. The buttons and styling work.

Packages Installed:
npm i bootstrap@5.3.3
pip install django
(djongo, psycopg2, django-mssql-backend also installed, but the databases were not able to be used)
